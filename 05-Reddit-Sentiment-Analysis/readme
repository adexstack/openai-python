Todo: refactor my self created sentiment_analysis.py to use OOP (currently all implemented in one .py file)
Todo: add credit card to openai to avoid "openai.error.RateLimitError" error

Reddit API:
Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
Click "create application"
Name: My Sentiment Example
Choose script
Leave description and about url blank
Add http://www.example.com/unused/redirect/uri to redirect uri

There should be similar openai response after running the script if all goes OK:
Sentiment:
Company: Pfizer
Sentiment: Negative
