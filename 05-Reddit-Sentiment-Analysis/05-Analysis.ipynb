      "At any point so far in its history, Amazon could have completely stopped reinvesting and simply watched the cash roll in with no further growth. In order to answer whether it's been wise to do it the way they've done it, just look at the numbers.\n",

      "Assuming a flat 10% margin, choosing to reinvest and build their business results in 20 times the profit in 2021 vs 2009. And that is actually insanely conservative considering the real story is that they had no profit in 2009, and their margins in 2021 would be far better than 10% if they did not reinvest.\n",
      "\n",
      "They could stop growth in its tracks right now and produce 10's of billions in pure profit per year. How anyone could question their strategy thus far is ridiculous. They've knocked it out of the park, creating insane wealth and even brand new sectors in commerce. Historically, there are very few businesses ever who have been this successful, this smart with capital, and produced this degree of wealth for shareholders.\n",
      "All I know is that if they ever do stop reinvesting, I’m going to be collecting a fat dividend.\n",

      "Was there a pandemic in 1971 and 1972?   No, so high employment growth in 1973 before a recession is not comparable.\n",
      "We wont know some of the effects of the increase of inflation and interest rates until Q2 2023. We are seeing euphoria at the moment because Fed predictably rose 25bps and some companies are doing better than expected. There is still an excess of money on the economy and supply is still trying to go back to normal from the Covid crash. Also past events don't correlate to future events.\n",
